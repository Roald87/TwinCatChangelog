# TE2000: TwinCAT 3 HMI 

## Version 1.10.1336.203

### Bug fix

- The HMI doesn't randomly write values into function block. Note: I'm not 100% sure if it was fixed in this version, or one between 1.10.1171.165 and 1.10.1336.203.

## Version 1.10.1171.165

**Warning: DO NOT USE THIS VERSION. It contains a serious bug, where sometimes the HMI would randomly write default values into function blocks.**
