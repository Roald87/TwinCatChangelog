## Contributing

If you noticed that a bug was fixed in a certain version or a certain feature was added, please:

- use the edit pencil present on each page at <https://twincatchangelog.github.io>,
- or add it via a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

In case you have a larger change in mind, please first open [an issue](https://github.com/Roald87/TwinCatChangelog/issues) such that it can be discussed first. For example, if you want to add a new page, or restructure how the project is organized.
